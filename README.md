Title: Image Compression Using Principal Component Analysis

Overview:
This project aims to demonstrate image compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in various fields including image processing and computer vision. By applying PCA to images, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of its important information. This is particularly useful in image compression where we want to reduce the size of the image file while minimizing the loss of image quality.
